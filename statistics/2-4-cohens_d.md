[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> Exercise 2.4 Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies
are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s d to quantify the
difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in
pregnancy length?

First I tried to calculate the mean, std and var of first babies and others and found the mean weight of firsts is lighter (7.201 lbs) then the others (7.326 lbs) 
The stardard deviation of the firsts was higher (1.42) than the others (1.39) but not by much.

For totalwgt_lb between firsts and others
When I computed Cohen's d the d = -0.088672927072602

For pregnancy length between firsts and others
When I computed Cohen's d the d = 0.028879044654449883

Both are really small and thus have a really small effect size.
